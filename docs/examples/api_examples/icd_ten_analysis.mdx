## Overview

This example demonstrates how to create a concurrent workflow swarm for analyzing ICD-10 codes using multiple specialized agents.

## Step 1: Installation

Install the required package:

```bash
pip install swarms-client python-dotenv
```

## Step 2: API Key Setup

Set your API key in a `.env` file:

```bash
SWARMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Step 3: Code Example

```python
import json
import os
from swarms_client import SwarmsClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = SwarmsClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY"),
)

patient_symptoms = """
Patient: 45-year-old female
Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath for 2 days

Symptoms:
- Sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breathing
- Shortness of breath, especially when lying down
- Mild fever (100.2°F)
- Dry cough
- Fatigue

            "system_prompt": "You are an expert ICD code explainer. Your task is to provide additional context, nuances, and secondary explanations for the ICD codes, including possible differential diagnoses and related codes.",
            "model_name": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            "role": "worker",
            "max_loops": 1,

            "temperature": 0.5,
        },
    ],
)

print(json.dumps(out, indent=4))
```

Run the script to analyze patient symptoms and generate ICD-10 code analysis using a concurrent workflow with multiple specialized agents working in parallel.
