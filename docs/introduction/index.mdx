Welcome to Swarms.

Swarms is building production-grade infrastructure for the agent economy, the core systems, protocols, and tools that enable autonomous AI agents to work independently, collaborate with one another, and participate in real economic activity at scale. As work shifts from isolated AI tools to coordinated networks of intelligent agents, Swarms provides a comprehensive platform to build, deploy, and scale these systems reliably in real-world environments.

Creating production-ready agent systems is hard, requiring robust orchestration, high-performance runtimes, seamless communication, and real-time payment infrastructure. Swarms delivers a complete, integrated stack: multi-agent orchestration for hierarchical, parallel, and collaborative workflows; a high-efficiency runtime optimized for concurrency; built-in economic infrastructure for usage-based transactions; and developer-friendly APIs that abstract away complexity. Swarms gives you everything needed to move agent systems from prototype to production.

## Our Mission

At The Swarm Corporation, we're creating the infrastructure layer that powers the agent economy. We provide the tools, protocols, and platforms that enable developers to build, deploy, and scale intelligent AI systems that can collaborate, reason, and solve complex problems together.
