At The Swarm Corporation, our mission is to build the infrastructure for the agent economy—the foundational systems, protocols, and tools that enable autonomous AI agents to transform how we work, create, and solve problems. The agent economy is not about individual AI assistants; it is about creating an ecosystem where autonomous agents collaborate, coordinate, and participate in economic transactions at scale. We envision a future where agents handle routine work and complex multi-agent coordination, freeing humans to focus on creative, strategic, and high-value activities. This infrastructure must be robust, performant, and designed to support real-time processing, high throughput, usage-based pricing, and automatic settlement—enabling agents to operate autonomously in economic transactions.

Through Swarms API, we provide the orchestration and execution platform for building multi-agent systems at any scale, enabling hierarchical, sequential, and parallel agent workflows that coordinate seamlessly. Through the ATP Protocol, we provide the economic infrastructure for seamless transactions between agents and users, with payment settlement on Solana ensuring transparency, auditability, and real-time performance. Together, these form the complete infrastructure for a world where agents operate autonomously, participate in markets, and collaborate to solve previously intractable problems. We are building the foundation for a future where human and agent work becomes seamless, where agents augment human capabilities, and where the agent economy creates new opportunities for innovation and growth.
