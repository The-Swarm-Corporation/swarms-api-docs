description: "Learn how creators earn fees from marketplace transactions"
---

Creators on the Swarms Marketplace earn fees from all buy and sell transactions involving their listed products. This provides a sustainable revenue stream for content creators.

---

## Fee Structure

Creators earn **0.5%** (half a percent) of the total transaction volume on both **buys** and **sells** for their listed products.

<Info>
The 0.5% fee applies to the total transaction volume, not just the creator's portion. This means creators earn fees on every transaction, whether it's a purchase or sale of their product.
</Info>

### Example Calculation

If a product has a transaction volume of $1,000:
- Creator fee: $1,000 × 0.5% = **$5.00**

This fee is automatically calculated and credited to the creator for each transaction.

## How It Works

  <Card title="Buy Transactions" icon="shopping-cart">
    When someone purchases your product, you earn 0.5% of the purchase amount as a creator fee.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sell Transactions" icon="arrow-right">
    When your product is resold, you continue to earn 0.5% of the sale volume.
  </Card>

This fee structure ensures creators are rewarded for their contributions to the marketplace ecosystem, creating ongoing value for both creators and the platform.
