## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Agents | Prompts |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Code** | ✅ Contains executable code | ❌ No code |
| **Requirements** | ✅ Package dependencies | ❌ None |
| **Environment Variables** | ✅ Configurable | ❌ None |
| **Export to ChatGPT** | ❌ Not available | ✅ Available |
| **Export to Claude** | ❌ Not available | ✅ Available |
| **View Modes** | Overview, JSON Metadata | Chat, Preview, Markdown, Text, Framework, API |
| **Downloadable Files** | ✅ Code files | ❌ Text only |

## Agents

Agents are **autonomous AI entities with executable code**. They contain implementation logic that can be run, configured, and integrated into your applications.

### Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Executable Code" icon="code">
    Agents include actual code (Python, JavaScript, etc.) that implements the agent's logic and behaviors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Package Requirements" icon="box">
    Agents specify their dependencies, showing which packages need to be installed (e.g., `pip install swarms`).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="key">
    Agents can require environment variables for API keys and configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Downloadable Files" icon="download">
    Download the agent's code files directly from the marketplace.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Agent Page Sections

When viewing an agent in the marketplace, you'll see:

- **Overview** - Description, use cases, and general information
- **JSON Metadata** - Structured data about the agent
- **Requirements** - List of packages and installation commands
- **Environment Variables** - Required configuration variables
- **Agent Code** - The full implementation code with syntax highlighting

### Best For

- Complex automation tasks
- Multi-step workflows
- Integration with external APIs and tools
- Custom logic and behaviors
- Reusable code components

## Prompts

Prompts are **system prompt templates without any code**. They define how an AI should behave, respond, and process information through natural language instructions.

### Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Code Required" icon="file-lines">
    Prompts are pure text instructions—no programming knowledge needed to use them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export to ChatGPT" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    One-click export to use the prompt directly in ChatGPT.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export to Claude" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    One-click export to use the prompt directly in Claude.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple View Modes" icon="eye">
    View prompts in different formats: Chat, Preview, Markdown, Text, Framework, or API.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Prompt Page Sections

When viewing a prompt in the marketplace, you'll see:

- **Main Prompt** - The full prompt text with multiple view options:
  - **Chat** - Interactive chat preview
  - **Preview** - Formatted preview
  - **Markdown** - Raw markdown format
  - **Text** - Plain text format
  - **Framework** - Format for Swarms Framework integration
  - **API** - Format for API integration

### Export to AI Platforms

Prompts include an **"Export to AI"** feature that allows you to:

- Export directly to **ChatGPT** for immediate use
- Export directly to **Claude** for immediate use

This makes it easy to try prompts across different AI platforms without manual copying.

### Best For

- System prompts for AI assistants
- Persona definitions
- Task-specific instructions
- Role-playing scenarios
- Structured output templates

---
