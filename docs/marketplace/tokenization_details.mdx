description: "Learn about token creation costs and bonding curve progression for tokenized agents and prompts"

Tokenization allows you to create a unique token on the Solana blockchain for your agent or prompt, enabling tradeable assets and token-based ecosystems.

<Info>
Tokenization applies to both **agents** and **prompts** published on the Swarms Marketplace.
</Info>

## Token Creation Cost 🪙

To officially tokenize your agent or associated prompt, you must pay a token creation fee to cover blockchain transaction costs.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Creation Fee" icon="coins">
    **0.04 SOL**
    
    Approximately **$4 USD** at current rates (fluctuates with SOL price)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Payment Method" icon="wallet">
    Paid during the tokenization process when launching your product
    
    One-time fee per tokenized product
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
The USD equivalent of 0.04 SOL fluctuates with the current SOL price. The fee is always charged in SOL, not USD.
</Warning>

## Bonding Curve Progression

Tokenized products use a bonding curve mechanism that determines token pricing and market dynamics. The bonding curve progresses through different market cap stages.

### Market Cap Stages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Market Cap">
    Your token starts at **18 SOL equivalent** when first created.
    
    This represents the initial valuation of your tokenized product.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Growth">
    As users purchase tokens, the market cap increases along the bonding curve.
    
    Early buyers get better prices, while later buyers pay more as demand increases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Graduation Market Cap">
    When the market cap reaches **400 SOL equivalent**, the token graduates from the virtual pool.
    
    At this point, the token becomes fully tradeable on decentralized exchanges.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Bonding Curves Work

Bonding curves create a predictable pricing mechanism that rewards early adopters while providing liquidity:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Price Discovery">
    Token price increases as more tokens are purchased, creating natural price discovery based on demand.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Early Adopter Rewards">
    Users who purchase tokens early benefit from lower prices, incentivizing early participation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Liquidity Provision">
    The bonding curve provides continuous liquidity without requiring traditional market makers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Graduation Benefits">
    Once graduated, tokens can be traded on DEXs, providing additional liquidity and trading opportunities.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tokenization Process

When you choose tokenization as your monetization option:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Tokenization">
    Choose **Tokenization** as your monetization method when launching your agent or prompt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Ticker Symbol">
    Provide a unique ticker symbol (max 10 characters, uppercase letters and numbers only).
    
    Examples: `AGENT`, `MYBOT`, `DATA123`, `RESEARCH`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pay Creation Fee">
    Pay the **0.04 SOL** token creation fee to cover blockchain transaction costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Creation">
    Your token is minted on the Solana blockchain with an initial market cap of **18 SOL**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Growth">
    As users purchase your token, the market cap grows along the bonding curve toward **400 SOL**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Graduation">
    Upon reaching **400 SOL** market cap, your token graduates and becomes fully tradeable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Considerations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost Fluctuation" icon="dollar-sign">
    SOL prices fluctuate, so the USD equivalent of 0.04 SOL will vary over time.
    
    Always check current SOL prices before tokenizing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="One-Time Fee" icon="receipt">
    The 0.04 SOL fee is a one-time payment per tokenized product.
    
    No recurring fees for maintaining the token.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Market Cap Targets" icon="target">
    The 18 SOL initial and 400 SOL graduation caps are fixed in SOL terms.
    
    USD values will fluctuate with SOL price.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Graduation Timeline" icon="clock">
    Time to graduation depends on market demand and token purchases.
    
    Popular products may graduate faster than others.
  </Card>
