title: 'Priority Processing'
description: 'Learn how the Swarms API handles request priority for premium subscribers during high demand periods'
---


The Swarms API uses a fair and efficient system to handle requests, especially during periods of high demand. Premium subscribers (such as those on Pro, Ultra, or higher tiers) receive priority processing for their requests. This helps ensure faster and more reliable performance when the system is busy.

Free tier users may experience slightly longer wait times under heavy load, but the system is designed to serve everyone reliably.

## How Priority Works

### Premium Priority

Requests from premium accounts are processed ahead of free tier requests when resources are limited. This includes benefits like access to closer servers (availability zones) for reduced latency.

### Fairness for All

The system prevents any single tier from overwhelming resources, ensuring free users still get service without excessive delays.

### No Changes Needed

This happens automatically based on your API key and subscription no extra code or settings required on your end.

## Benefits for Premium Users

- Quicker response times during peak usage
- Better overall performance and consistency
- Additional perks like higher rate limits and priority support
