description: 'The principles and values that guide how we build the Swarms API platform and shape the agent economy.'
---


Every feature, every decision, and every line of code in the Swarms API is guided by a set of core principles. These principles ensure we build tools that are powerful, accessible, and aligned with our mission of building the agent economy.

## Core Principles

### 1. Developer-First

**Developers are our foundation.** We build for developers who are creating the future, and we prioritize their experience above all else.

**What this means:**

- **Intuitive APIs** - Clear, consistent interfaces that feel natural to use
- **Comprehensive documentation** - Detailed guides, examples, and references
- **Fast iteration** - Tools that let you build and test quickly
- **Transparent behavior** - Predictable, well-documented functionality
- **Community feedback** - We listen and respond to developer needs

**In practice:**

```python
# Simple, intuitive API design
client = SwarmsClient(api_key=api_key)
result = client.agent.run(
    agent_config={...},
    task="Your task here"
)
```

### 2. Power Through Simplicity

**Complex problems don't require complex solutions.** We believe the best tools are powerful yet simple—they handle complexity internally while presenting a clean interface.

**What this means:**

- **Abstraction over configuration** - Sensible defaults that work for most cases
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple for beginners, powerful for experts
- **Minimal boilerplate** - Get started quickly, customize when needed
- **Clear mental models** - Concepts that map to how you think about problems

**Example:**

You can start with a simple agent configuration and gradually add complexity as needed:

```python
# Simple - works out of the box
agent_config = {
    "agent_name": "Assistant",
    "system_prompt": "You are helpful.",
    "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini"
}

# Advanced - when you need more control
agent_config = {
    "agent_name": "Specialist",
    "system_prompt": "You are an expert...",
    "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4",
    "tools_list_dictionary": [...],
    "max_loops": 5,
    "temperature": 0.7
}
```

### 3. Scale Without Compromise

**Performance and scale shouldn't be trade-offs.** You shouldn't have to choose between building something that works and something that scales.

**What this means:**

- **Built for scale** - Handle everything from prototypes to production systems
- **Efficient by default** - Optimized runtime and resource management
- **No artificial limits** - Scale from one agent to thousands seamlessly
- **Production-ready** - Reliability and performance you can depend on

**Capabilities:**

- Support for 10,000+ agents in a single swarm
- Ultra-optimized execution runtime
- Concurrent processing for maximum efficiency
- Enterprise-grade reliability and uptime

### 4. Open and Extensible

**The best platforms are platforms others can build on.** We provide the foundation, and you build what matters to you.

**What this means:**

- **Flexible architecture** - Support multiple workflow patterns and use cases
- **Tool integration** - Extend agent capabilities with custom functions
- **Multi-model support** - Choose the right model for each task
- **API-first design** - Build integrations with any language or framework
- **Community-driven** - Open to contributions and feedback

**Extensibility:**

```python
# Add custom tools to extend agent capabilities
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "custom_analysis",
            "description": "Perform specialized analysis",
            "parameters": {...}
        }
    }
]
```

### 5. Transparent and Honest

**Trust is built through transparency.** We're honest about capabilities, limitations, pricing, and our roadmap.

**What this means:**

- **Clear pricing** - No hidden fees, transparent cost structure
- **Honest limitations** - We tell you what works and what doesn't
- **Open communication** - Regular updates and clear roadmap
- **Fair practices** - Ethical use, responsible AI, user privacy

**Transparency in action:**

- Detailed pricing breakdowns
- Clear rate limits and quotas
- Open API specifications
- Regular changelog updates

### 6. Safety and Responsibility

**Powerful tools require responsible stewardship.** We build with safety, security, and ethical considerations from the ground up.

**What this means:**

- **Security first** - Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- **Ethical AI** - Responsible use and deployment practices
- **User privacy** - Protection of user data and information
- **Access controls** - Granular permissions and governance

**Security features:**

- API key authentication
- Encrypted data transmission
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Enterprise compliance features

## Design Decisions

### Why REST APIs?

REST APIs are universal, language-agnostic, and work with any toolchain. They're the foundation that makes our platform accessible to everyone.

### Why Multiple Workflow Patterns?

Different problems require different approaches. Sequential workflows for pipelines, concurrent for parallel processing, hierarchical for complex decision-making. We support them all.

### Why Multi-Model Support?

No single model is perfect for every task. By supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, and Groq, you can choose the right tool for each job.

### Why Agent-to-Agent Communication?

True multi-agent systems require agents to communicate, share information, and collaborate. This isn't just multiple agents—it's a coordinated team.

### Why Developer Experience Focus?

Developers are the builders of the agent economy. By making their experience exceptional, we accelerate the entire ecosystem.

## Evolution and Learning

Our design philosophy isn't static. As we learn from developers, observe how the platform is used, and see new patterns emerge, we evolve our approach.

**We're always learning:**

- From developer feedback and feature requests
- From usage patterns and performance data
- From the broader AI and agent ecosystem
- From our own experiments and research

**We adapt:**

- Adding new workflow patterns as needs emerge
- Improving APIs based on developer feedback
- Optimizing performance based on real-world usage
- Expanding capabilities as the ecosystem grows

## Building Together

Our design philosophy guides us, but the platform is shaped by everyone who uses it. Your feedback, your use cases, and your innovations inform how we build.

**We want to hear from you:**

- What works well and what doesn't
- What features you need
- What patterns you're discovering
- What challenges you're facing
