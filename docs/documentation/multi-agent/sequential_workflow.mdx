**Swarm Type**: `SequentialWorkflow`

## Overview

The SequentialWorkflow swarm type executes tasks in a strict, predefined order where each step depends on the completion of the previous one. This architecture is perfect for workflows that require a linear progression of tasks, ensuring that each agent builds upon the work of the previous agent.

Key features:
- **Ordered Execution**: Agents execute in a specific, predefined sequence
- **Step Dependencies**: Each step builds upon previous results
- **Predictable Flow**: Clear, linear progression through the workflow
- **Quality Control**: Each agent can validate and enhance previous work

## Use Cases

- Document processing pipelines
- Multi-stage analysis workflows
- Content creation and editing processes
- Data transformation and validation pipelines

## API Usage

## Tutorial: Build a Legal Document Review Pipeline

In this tutorial, you'll build a complete legal document review system that processes contracts through multiple specialized agents. By the end, you'll have a production-ready pipeline that extracts key terms, identifies risks, suggests improvements, and generates a final summary.

### What You'll Build

A 4-stage document review pipeline:
1. **Document Parser** - Extracts and structures document content
2. **Risk Analyst** - Identifies potential legal risks and red flags
3. **Compliance Checker** - Verifies regulatory compliance
4. **Summary Generator** - Creates an executive summary with recommendations

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Swarms API key ([get one here](https://swarms.world))
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, create a new Python file and set up your configuration:

```python
import requests
import json
import os

# Configuration
API_BASE_URL = "https://api.swarms.world"
API_KEY = os.environ.get("SWARMS_API_KEY", "your_api_key_here")

headers = {
    "x-api-key": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

<Tip>
Store your API key in an environment variable for security:
```bash
export SWARMS_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"
```
</Tip>

### Step 2: Define Your Specialized Agents

Each agent in a SequentialWorkflow has a specific role. The order matters - each agent receives the output from the previous one.

```python
def create_document_review_agents():
    """Create specialized agents for document review pipeline."""

    return [
        {
            "agent_name": "Document Parser",
            "description": "Extracts and structures key information from legal documents",
            "system_prompt": """You are an expert legal document parser. Your job is to:
1. Identify the document type (contract, agreement, NDA, etc.)
2. Extract all parties involved and their roles
3. List key dates (effective date, termination, renewal)
4. Extract financial terms (amounts, payment schedules, penalties)
5. Identify all obligations for each party
6. Note any defined terms and their definitions

Format your output as structured sections for easy downstream processing.
Be thorough but concise. Flag any sections that are unclear or potentially missing.""",

            "description": "Identifies potential legal risks and red flags",
            "system_prompt": """You are a legal risk analyst. Based on the parsed document information provided:

   - Intellectual property transfer clauses

2. Identify MEDIUM RISK items:
   - Ambiguous language that could be interpreted unfavorably
   - Missing standard protections
   - Unusual penalty structures

3. Identify LOW RISK items:
   - Minor formatting or language improvements
   - Industry-standard terms that could be negotiated

For each risk, explain:
- What the risk is
- Why it matters
- Potential business impact
- Suggested mitigation""",

            "temperature": 0.4
        }
    ]
```

### Step 3: Build the Pipeline Function

Create a reusable function that runs documents through the pipeline:

```python
def review_legal_document(document_text: str, document_name: str = "Document") -> dict:
    """
    Process a legal document through the sequential review pipeline.

    Args:
        document_text: The full text of the legal document
        document_name: A name/identifier for the document

    Returns:
        dict: Complete API response with all agent outputs
    """

    swarm_config = {
        "name": f"Legal Review: {document_name}",
        "description": "Sequential legal document review pipeline",
        "swarm_type": "SequentialWorkflow",
        "task": f"""Please review the following legal document:

---
{document_text}
---

Process this document through each stage of review.""",
        "agents": create_document_review_agents(),
        "max_loops": 1
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{API_BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=swarm_config,
        timeout=120  # Legal documents may take time to process
    )

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception(f"API Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

### Step 4: Process Results

Create helper functions to extract and display results:

```python
def display_review_results(result: dict):
    """Display the review results in a readable format."""

    print("=" * 60)
    print(f"LEGAL DOCUMENT REVIEW COMPLETE")
    print(f"Job ID: {result.get('job_id', 'N/A')}")
    print("=" * 60)

    # Extract outputs from each agent
    outputs = result.get("output", [])

    for output in outputs:
        role = output.get("role", "Unknown")
        content = output.get("content", "")

        print(f"\n{'─' * 40}")
        print(f"📋 {role.upper()}")
        print(f"{'─' * 40}")
        print(content[:1000] + "..." if len(content) > 1000 else content)

    # Display cost information
    usage = result.get("usage", {})
    billing = usage.get("billing_info", {})

    print(f"\n{'=' * 60}")
    print("USAGE SUMMARY")
    print(f"  Total tokens: {usage.get('total_tokens', 0):,}")
    print(f"  Total cost: ${billing.get('total_cost', 0):.4f}")
    print(f"  Execution time: {result.get('execution_time', 0):.1f}s")
    print("=" * 60)


def extract_final_recommendation(result: dict) -> str:
    """Extract just the final recommendation from Summary Generator."""

    outputs = result.get("output", [])

    for output in outputs:
        if output.get("role") == "Summary Generator":
            return output.get("content", "No recommendation available")

    return "Summary not found"
```

### Step 5: Run the Complete Pipeline

Put it all together with a sample document:

```python
def main():
    # Sample contract text (in production, you'd read from a file or input)
    sample_contract = """
    SERVICE AGREEMENT

    This Service Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of January 15, 2025
    by and between:

    Provider: TechCorp Solutions Inc., a Delaware corporation
    Client: Acme Industries LLC, a California limited liability company

    1. SERVICES
    Provider agrees to deliver cloud infrastructure management services
    including 24/7 monitoring, incident response, and monthly reporting.

    2. TERM
    This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for 36 months,
    automatically renewing for successive 12-month periods unless terminated
    with 30 days written notice.

    3. FEES
    Client shall pay Provider $15,000 per month, due within 30 days of invoice.
    Late payments incur 2% monthly interest. Provider may suspend services
    for payments more than 45 days overdue.

    4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    PROVIDER'S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID IN THE
    PRECEDING 3 MONTHS. IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE FOR
    INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

    5. INDEMNIFICATION
    Client shall indemnify and hold harmless Provider from any claims
    arising from Client's use of the services or Client's data.

    6. TERMINATION
    Provider may terminate immediately for material breach. Client may
    terminate with 90 days notice and payment of remaining term fees.

    7. GOVERNING LAW
    This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Delaware.
    """

    print("Starting legal document review...")
    print("Processing through 4-stage pipeline...\n")

    try:
        # Run the review
        result = review_legal_document(
            document_text=sample_contract,
            document_name="TechCorp Service Agreement"
        )

        # Display full results
        display_review_results(result)

        # Get quick recommendation
        print("\n🎯 QUICK RECOMMENDATION:")
        print(extract_final_recommendation(result))

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 6: Customize for Your Use Case

Adapt the pipeline for different document types:

```python
# For NDA Review - modify the Risk Analyst prompt
nda_risk_prompt = """Focus on:
- Definition of Confidential Information scope
- Duration of confidentiality obligations
- Permitted disclosures and exceptions
- Return/destruction of information requirements
- Non-compete or non-solicit provisions"""

# For Employment Contracts - add specialized agent
employment_agent = {
    "agent_name": "Employment Law Specialist",
    "description": "Reviews employment-specific terms",
    "system_prompt": """Review for:
    - At-will vs. fixed-term employment
    - Non-compete geographic and time restrictions
    - IP assignment clauses
    - Benefits and equity provisions
    - Termination and severance terms""",
    "model_name": "gpt-4o",
    "max_loops": 1,
    "temperature": 0.2
}
```

### Expected Output

When you run the pipeline, you'll see output like:

```
============================================================
LEGAL DOCUMENT REVIEW COMPLETE

```

### Key Takeaways

1. **Agent Order Matters**: Each agent builds on the previous output. Parser → Analyst → Compliance → Summary creates a logical flow.

2. **Temperature Settings**: Use lower temperatures (0.2-0.3) for extraction and analysis, slightly higher (0.4-0.5) for summaries.

3. **System Prompts Are Critical**: Detailed prompts with specific instructions and expected output formats produce better results.

4. **Error Handling**: Always include timeouts and error handling for production use.

5. **Customization**: Swap agents or modify prompts to adapt the pipeline for different document types.

## Best Practices

- Design workflows with clear dependencies between steps
- Use for tasks that require sequential processing
- Ensure each agent builds upon previous results effectively
- Ideal for quality control and validation workflows
