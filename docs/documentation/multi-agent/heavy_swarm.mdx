**Swarm Type**: `HeavySwarm`

## Overview

The HeavySwarm is a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system inspired by X.AI's Grok 4 Heavy architecture. It automatically decomposes complex tasks into specialized questions and executes them using five built-in specialized agents: Research, Analysis, Alternatives, Verification, and Synthesis. Unlike other swarm types, HeavySwarm creates and manages its own agents internally — pass an empty `agents` array (`"agents": []`) in the request.

Key features:
- **Automatic Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are intelligently broken down into specialized questions using function calling
- **Five Specialized Agents**: Research, Analysis, Alternatives, Verification, and Synthesis agents work in concert
- **Parallel Execution**: Four specialist agents execute simultaneously for maximum efficiency
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multi-loop execution where each loop builds upon previous results
- **Comprehensive Synthesis**: A dedicated synthesis agent integrates all findings into an executive-ready report

## Architecture

The HeavySwarm follows a structured 5-phase workflow:

1. **Task Decomposition** — A question generation agent analyzes the input task and creates four specialized questions using function calling
2. **Parallel Execution** — Four specialized agents (Research, Analysis, Alternatives, Verification) execute their questions simultaneously
3. **Result Collection** — Outputs are validated and collected from all agents
4. **Synthesis** — A fifth Synthesis agent integrates all results into a comprehensive report
5. **Iterative Refinement** — When `heavy_swarm_loops_per_agent` > 1, the process repeats with context from previous iterations

### Specialized Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Research Agent** | Comprehensive information gathering, source verification, data collection, and systematic search strategies |
| **Analysis Agent** | Statistical analysis, pattern recognition, causal relationship identification, and predictive modeling |
| **Alternatives Agent** | Strategic option generation, creative problem-solving, scenario planning, and trade-off analysis |
| **Verification Agent** | Fact-checking, feasibility assessment, risk assessment, and compliance verification |
| **Synthesis Agent** | Multi-perspective integration, executive summaries, strategic alignment, and actionable recommendations |

## HeavySwarm-Specific Parameters

Since HeavySwarm manages its own agents, it uses dedicated parameters at the swarm configuration level:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `heavy_swarm_loops_per_agent` | `integer` | `1` | Number of execution loops per agent. Higher values enable iterative refinement for deeper analysis. |
| `heavy_swarm_question_agent_model_name` | `string` | `"gpt-4.1"` | Model used for the question generation phase. This agent decomposes the task into specialized questions. |
| `heavy_swarm_worker_model_name` | `string` | `"claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` | Model used for all five specialized worker agents (Research, Analysis, Alternatives, Verification, Synthesis). |

## Use Cases

- Deep research and comprehensive market analysis
- Due diligence and investment research
- Policy analysis and strategic planning
- Technology assessment and competitive intelligence
- Complex problem-solving requiring multiple perspectives
- Medical or scientific research synthesis

## Best Practices

- Use HeavySwarm for complex tasks that benefit from multi-perspective analysis rather than simple queries
- Start with `heavy_swarm_loops_per_agent: 1` and increase only when deeper iterative analysis is needed
- Choose the question agent model carefully — it determines the quality of task decomposition which drives the entire workflow
- Use a capable worker model (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) for the specialized agents to get high-quality research, analysis, and verification
- HeavySwarm requires an empty `agents` array (`"agents": []`) in the request — all five agents are created and managed internally
- For time-sensitive tasks, keep `max_loops` at 1; increase for comprehensive research where thoroughness is prioritized over speed
- Schedule non-urgent deep analysis during off-peak hours (8 PM - 6 AM PT) for cost savings
