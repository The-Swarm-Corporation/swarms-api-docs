---

**Swarm Type**: `GroupChat`

## Overview

The GroupChat swarm type facilitates collaborative discussion between multiple specialist agents. Unlike workflows where agents operate independently, GroupChat enables agents to engage in a shared conversation where each participant can build on, challenge, and refine ideas from others. This architecture is ideal for brainstorming, cross-functional planning, and problems that benefit from interactive dialogue.

Key features:
- **Collaborative Discussion**: Agents engage in shared conversation rather than working in isolation
- **Cross-Functional Input**: Combine perspectives from different domains in a single discussion
- **Idea Building**: Each agent can react to and build on contributions from other participants
- **Convergent Outcomes**: Discussion naturally converges toward actionable conclusions

## Use Cases

- Product strategy brainstorming sessions
- Cross-functional planning and alignment
- Architectural design discussions
- Risk assessment with multiple stakeholders
- Creative ideation requiring diverse perspectives

## API Usage

MVP priority for launch: (1) AI task assignment — this is the core differentiator, (2) Slack integration — lowest friction adoption path, (3) standup summaries — immediate daily value. I'd defer Jira migration and delivery risk prediction post-launch. Success metrics: 50 teams onboarded in 8 weeks, 60% WAU after first month."

CAC $35-50), and a beta user referral program ($10K). Pricing: free tier up to 5 users as growth loop, Pro at $12/user/month targeting ~$2,500 ACV, with a 40% launch discount on annual plans for the first 3 months."

Risks: GitHub integration adds 2-3 weeks for bidirectional sync, recommend starting with read-only status sync (1 week). AI assignment accuracy has a cold-start problem for new teams — suggest manual override plus learning mode. Timeline: 6 weeks eng + 2 weeks buffer, doable if we freeze scope now."

## Best Practices

- Design agents with complementary but distinct expertise to maximize discussion breadth
- Use descriptive system prompts that instruct agents to build on and react to other participants' input
- GroupChat works best with 3-6 agents — too few limits perspective diversity, too many dilutes focus
- Ideal for brainstorming and planning tasks where interactive dialogue adds more value than independent analysis
