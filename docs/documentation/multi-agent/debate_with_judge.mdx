**Swarm Type**: `DebateWithJudge`

## Overview

The DebateWithJudge swarm type implements a structured debate architecture with progressive self-refinement. Two debater agents — one arguing in favor (Pro) and one arguing against (Con) — present opposing arguments on a given topic. An impartial Judge agent evaluates both sides, provides feedback, and synthesizes the strongest elements into a refined answer. This process repeats over multiple loops, with each round producing progressively better arguments and a more nuanced final synthesis.

Key features:
- **Structured Argumentation**: Pro and Con agents present opposing perspectives with evidence-based reasoning
- **Impartial Evaluation**: A Judge agent objectively assesses argument quality and provides constructive feedback
- **Progressive Refinement**: Each debate loop builds on the judge's synthesis, producing increasingly refined arguments
- **Convergent Synthesis**: The final output combines the strongest elements from both sides into a well-reasoned conclusion

## Use Cases

- Policy analysis requiring balanced pro/con evaluation
- Strategic decision-making with structured trade-off analysis
- Risk assessment where both opportunities and threats need rigorous examination
- Technology evaluation comparing competing approaches
- Investment analysis weighing bull and bear cases
- Ethical dilemma resolution with multi-perspective reasoning

## API Usage

### Basic DebateWithJudge Example

The DebateWithJudge architecture requires exactly **3 agents** in a specific order:
1. **Pro Agent** — argues in favor of the proposition
2. **Con Agent** — argues against the proposition
3. **Judge Agent** — evaluates both sides and provides synthesis

Iceland's 2015-2019 trial across 2,500 workers showed maintained or improved productivity with significantly better employee wellbeing. A 4-day week reduces burnout (Gallup reports 76% of workers experience burnout at least sometimes), lowers turnover costs (replacing an employee costs 50-200% of salary), and gives companies a powerful recruiting advantage in a tight labor market. The compressed schedule forces better meeting discipline and eliminates low-value work. Companies like Bolt, Buffer, and Kickstarter have adopted it permanently with positive results."

First, the trials cherry-pick: Microsoft Japan's results came from a single month-long experiment with other simultaneous changes. Most successful cases are in knowledge work — manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and customer service cannot simply compress schedules without service gaps. Second, a mandatory policy removes flexibility: some employees prefer 5 shorter days, and some roles require daily client contact. Third, competitive risk: if your competitors operate 5 days and you operate 4, response times suffer. Finally, implementation costs are real — you may need to hire additional staff for coverage, offsetting any productivity gains."

The Con side raises important practical limitations, particularly around industry applicability and the weakness of short-term trial data. My synthesis: a 4-day work week should not be mandated universally but adopted selectively. Knowledge-work companies with output-based metrics are strong candidates. Companies should run 3-6 month pilots with clear KPIs before committing. The evidence supports that well-implemented compressed schedules can maintain productivity while improving wellbeing, but the approach must be tailored to industry, role type, and company culture rather than applied as a blanket policy."

## Best Practices

- Always provide exactly 3 agents in the correct order: Pro (first), Con (second), Judge (third)
- Design Pro and Con prompts to be balanced in depth — a one-sided debate produces a weak synthesis
- Use lower temperature (0.3-0.4) for the Judge agent to ensure consistent, objective evaluation
- Increase `max_loops` for complex topics that benefit from multiple rounds of refinement — each loop produces stronger arguments
- DebateWithJudge works best for binary or comparative questions where opposing perspectives add genuine analytical value
