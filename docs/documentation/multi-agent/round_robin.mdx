**Swarm Type**: `RoundRobin`

## Overview

The RoundRobin swarm implements a collaborative communication pattern where agents take turns processing a task in a randomized round-robin fashion. Each loop, agents are shuffled into a random order and each receives the full conversation history, encouraging them to build upon and refine previous agents' contributions. This creates a natural collaborative dynamic similar to a brainstorming session.

Key features:
- **Randomized Turn Order**: Agents are shuffled each loop for varied interaction patterns
- **Full Conversation Context**: Every agent sees the complete conversation history from prior agents
- **Collaborative Prompting**: Built-in prompts encourage agents to acknowledge and extend others' contributions
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple loops allow the group to progressively deepen their analysis
- **Automatic Retries**: Exponential backoff retry logic for resilient agent execution

## Use Cases

- Collaborative brainstorming and ideation sessions
- Research synthesis from multiple domain experts
- Code review with multiple engineering perspectives
- Content creation with iterative editorial refinement
- Strategic planning with cross-functional input

## Best Practices

- Use 3-5 agents for optimal collaboration — too many agents dilute the conversation context
- Each agent should have a clearly distinct expertise so contributions don't overlap
- Increase `max_loops` when you want agents to iterate and refine each other's ideas across multiple rounds
- Agent order is randomized each loop, so design prompts that work regardless of speaking position
- Ideal for tasks where diverse perspectives and iterative refinement produce better results than parallel independent work
