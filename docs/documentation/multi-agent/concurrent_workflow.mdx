name: "ConcurrentWorkflow"
description: "Parallel execution swarm that runs independent tasks simultaneously for faster processing and improved efficiency"
---

**Swarm Type**: `ConcurrentWorkflow`

## Overview

The ConcurrentWorkflow swarm type runs independent tasks in parallel, significantly reducing processing time for complex operations. This architecture is ideal for tasks that can be processed simultaneously without dependencies, allowing multiple agents to work on different aspects of a problem at the same time.

Key features:
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Reduced Processing Time**: Faster completion through parallelization
- **Independent Tasks**: Agents work on separate, non-dependent subtasks
- **Scalable Performance**: Performance scales with the number of agents

## Use Cases

- Independent data analysis tasks
- Parallel content generation
- Multi-source research projects
- Distributed problem solving

## API Usage

## Tutorial: Build a Competitive Intelligence Dashboard

In this tutorial, you'll build a competitive intelligence system that analyzes multiple competitors simultaneously. Instead of researching one company at a time, ConcurrentWorkflow lets all analyses run in parallel - turning what could be a lengthy sequential process into a fast, efficient operation.

### What You'll Build

A parallel competitor analysis system that:
1. Researches **5 competitors simultaneously**
2. Analyzes each across multiple dimensions (products, pricing, market position)
3. Aggregates results into a unified dashboard view
4. Compares execution time vs. sequential approach

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Swarms API key ([get one here](https://swarms.world))
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

```python
import requests
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Configuration
API_BASE_URL = "https://api.swarms.world"
API_KEY = os.environ.get("SWARMS_API_KEY", "your_api_key_here")

headers = {
    "x-api-key": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Step 2: Define Your Competitor Analysis Agents

In ConcurrentWorkflow, each agent works **independently and in parallel**. Design agents so they don't depend on each other's output.

```python
def create_competitor_agents(competitors: list[str]) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Create one analysis agent per competitor.
    Each agent analyzes a single competitor independently.

    Args:
        competitors: List of competitor company names

    Returns:
        List of agent configurations
    """

    agents = []

    for competitor in competitors:
        agent = {
            "agent_name": f"{competitor} Analyst",
            "description": f"Analyzes {competitor}'s market position and strategy",
            "system_prompt": f"""You are a competitive intelligence analyst specializing in {competitor}.

Analyze {competitor} across these dimensions:

1. **COMPANY OVERVIEW**
   - Founded, headquarters, employee count
   - Recent funding/valuation (if applicable)
   - Key leadership

2. **PRODUCT ANALYSIS**
   - Core products/services
   - Recent launches or updates
   - Unique features vs. competitors
   - Known limitations or weaknesses

3. **MARKET POSITION**
   - Target customer segments
   - Estimated market share
   - Geographic presence
   - Key partnerships

4. **PRICING STRATEGY**
   - Pricing model (subscription, usage-based, etc.)
   - Price points for main offerings
   - Free tier or trial availability
   - Enterprise pricing approach

5. **STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES**
   - Top 3 competitive strengths
   - Top 3 vulnerabilities to exploit

6. **RECENT NEWS**
   - Notable announcements (last 6 months)
   - Strategic moves or pivots

Format your response with clear headers and bullet points.
Be specific with numbers and facts where possible.""",

            "temperature": 0.3  # Lower temperature for factual research
        }
        agents.append(agent)

    return agents
```

### Step 3: Build the Concurrent Analysis Function

```python
def analyze_competitors(
    competitors: list[str],
    industry: str,
    your_company: str
) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze multiple competitors in parallel.

    Args:
        competitors: List of competitor company names
        industry: The industry context
        your_company: Your company name for context

    Returns:
        dict: API response with parallel analysis results
    """

    agents = create_competitor_agents(competitors)

    swarm_config = {
        "name": f"Competitive Intelligence: {industry}",
        "description": f"Parallel competitor analysis for {your_company}",
        "swarm_type": "ConcurrentWorkflow",
        "task": f"""Conduct competitive intelligence analysis for {your_company}
in the {industry} industry.

Each analyst should focus on their assigned competitor and provide
a comprehensive analysis. We are analyzing: {', '.join(competitors)}.

        "agents": agents,
        "max_loops": 1
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{API_BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=swarm_config,
        timeout=180  # Parallel execution is faster but allow buffer
    )

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception(f"API Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

### Step 4: Create the Dashboard Display

```python
def display_competitive_dashboard(result: dict, your_company: str):
    """Format and display the competitive intelligence dashboard."""

    print("\n" + "=" * 70)
    print(f"🎯 COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARD")
    print(f"   Company: {your_company}")
    print(f"   Generated: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}")
    print("=" * 70)

    outputs = result.get("output", [])
    execution_time = result.get("execution_time", 0)
    num_competitors = len(outputs)

    # Display execution efficiency
    print(f"\n⚡ EXECUTION SUMMARY")
    print(f"   Competitors analyzed: {num_competitors}")
    print(f"   Total execution time: {execution_time:.1f}s")
    print(f"   Time per competitor (parallel): {execution_time:.1f}s")
    print(f"   Estimated sequential time: ~{execution_time * num_competitors:.1f}s")
    print(f"   Time saved: ~{(execution_time * num_competitors) - execution_time:.1f}s ({num_competitors}x faster)")

    # Display each competitor analysis
    for output in outputs:
        competitor = output.get("role", "Unknown").replace(" Analyst", "")
        content = output.get("content", "")

        print(f"\n{'─' * 70}")
        print(f"📊 {competitor.upper()}")
        print(f"{'─' * 70}")

        # Show first 1500 chars with indicator if truncated
        if len(content) > 1500:
            print(content[:1500])
            print(f"\n... [+{len(content) - 1500} more characters]")
        else:
            print(content)

    # Cost summary
    usage = result.get("usage", {})
    billing = usage.get("billing_info", {})

    print(f"\n{'=' * 70}")
    print("💰 COST SUMMARY")
    print(f"   Total tokens: {usage.get('total_tokens', 0):,}")
    print(f"   Total cost: ${billing.get('total_cost', 0):.4f}")
    if billing.get('discount_active'):
        print(f"   Discount: {billing.get('discount_percentage', 0)}% ({billing.get('discount_type', 'N/A')})")
    print("=" * 70)


def extract_competitor_summary(result: dict) -> dict:
    """Extract key competitive insights from each analysis."""

    summaries = {}
    outputs = result.get("output", [])

    for output in outputs:
        competitor = output.get("role", "Unknown").replace(" Analyst", "")
        content = output.get("content", "")

        # Extract key sections (simplified - in production use more robust parsing)
        summaries[competitor] = {
            "full_analysis": content,
            "word_count": len(content.split()),
        }

    return summaries
```

### Step 5: Add Comparison Matrix Generator

Create a side-by-side comparison view:

```python
def generate_comparison_prompt(competitors: list[str]) -> dict:
    """Generate an additional agent to create comparison matrix."""

    return {
        "agent_name": "Comparison Synthesizer",
        "description": "Creates side-by-side competitor comparison",
        "system_prompt": f"""You are a competitive intelligence synthesizer.

Based on the competitive analyses provided, create a comparison matrix
for these competitors: {', '.join(competitors)}

Create tables comparing:

1. **FEATURE COMPARISON**
| Feature | {' | '.join(competitors)} |
|---------|{'|'.join(['---' for _ in competitors])}|

2. **PRICING COMPARISON**
| Tier | {' | '.join(competitors)} |
|------|{'|'.join(['---' for _ in competitors])}|

3. **SWOT SUMMARY**
For each competitor, list:
- Key Strength
- Key Weakness
- Key Opportunity (for us)
- Key Threat (from them)

4. **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**
Top 5 actionable recommendations based on competitive gaps.

Be specific and actionable.""",
        "model_name": "gpt-4o",
        "max_loops": 1,
        "temperature": 0.4
    }
```

### Step 6: Run the Complete Analysis

```python
def main():
    # Configuration
    YOUR_COMPANY = "Acme AI"
    INDUSTRY = "AI Development Platforms"
    COMPETITORS = [
        "OpenAI",
        "Anthropic",
        "Google DeepMind",
        "Cohere",
        "Mistral AI"
    ]

    print("🔍 Starting Competitive Intelligence Analysis...")
    print(f"   Analyzing {len(COMPETITORS)} competitors in parallel...")
    print(f"   Competitors: {', '.join(COMPETITORS)}\n")

    try:
        # Run parallel analysis
        start_time = datetime.now()
        result = analyze_competitors(
            competitors=COMPETITORS,
            industry=INDUSTRY,
            your_company=YOUR_COMPANY
        )

        # Display dashboard
        display_competitive_dashboard(result, YOUR_COMPANY)

        # Extract summaries for further processing
        summaries = extract_competitor_summary(result)

        print(f"\n📁 Analysis complete. {len(summaries)} competitor profiles generated.")

        # Optionally save to file
        save_to_file = input("\nSave full report to file? (y/n): ").lower() == 'y'
        if save_to_file:
            filename = f"competitive_analysis_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M')}.json"
            with open(filename, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(result, f, indent=2)
            print(f"✅ Report saved to {filename}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 7: Advanced - Batch Multiple Industries

Scale the analysis across industries:

```python
def batch_competitive_analysis(analyses: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Run multiple competitive analyses for different industries/segments.

    Args:
        analyses: List of analysis configs with 'industry', 'competitors', 'company'

    Returns:
        List of results for each analysis
    """

    results = []

    for analysis in analyses:
        print(f"\n📊 Analyzing: {analysis['industry']}...")

        result = analyze_competitors(
            competitors=analysis['competitors'],
            industry=analysis['industry'],
            your_company=analysis['company']
        )
        results.append({
            "industry": analysis['industry'],
            "result": result
        })

    return results


# Example usage
batch_configs = [
    {
        "company": "Acme AI",
        "industry": "LLM Providers",
        "competitors": ["OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Cohere"]
    },
    {
        "company": "Acme AI",
        "industry": "AI Code Assistants",
        "competitors": ["GitHub Copilot", "Cursor", "Tabnine"]
    },
    {
        "company": "Acme AI",
        "industry": "AI Infrastructure",
        "competitors": ["Hugging Face", "Replicate", "Modal"]
    }
]
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **Parallel = Speed**: 5 competitors analyzed in the same time as 1. The more agents, the bigger the time savings.

2. **Independent Tasks Only**: ConcurrentWorkflow agents cannot see each other's output. Design tasks that don't require inter-agent communication.

3. **Same Task, Different Focus**: All agents receive the same task but their system prompts direct them to different targets.

4. **Consistent Output Format**: Use identical output structure across agents to make aggregation easier.

5. **Cost Efficiency**: Parallel execution doesn't increase cost - you pay the same tokens whether sequential or concurrent.

### When to Use ConcurrentWorkflow vs. SequentialWorkflow

| Use ConcurrentWorkflow When | Use SequentialWorkflow When |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Tasks are independent | Tasks have dependencies |
| Speed is critical | Order matters |
| Analyzing multiple items | Building on previous output |
| No inter-agent communication needed | Agents need to see prior work |
| Aggregating diverse perspectives | Creating a pipeline/chain |

## Best Practices

- Design independent tasks that don't require sequential dependencies
- Use for tasks that can be parallelized effectively
- Ensure agents have distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
- Ideal for time-sensitive analysis requiring multiple perspectives
