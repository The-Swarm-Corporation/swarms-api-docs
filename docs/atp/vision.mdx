description: 'The vision and purpose behind the Agent Trade Protocol - making ATP the standard for agentic trade'
---

ATP's goal is to become the standard protocol for agentic trade, enabling seamless economic interactions between AI agents through a robust, performant, and fair payment system. ATP (Agent Trade Protocol) enhances agent-to-agent payment and trade by addressing the critical need for low-latency payments at scale. Traditional payment systems are not designed for agent-to-agent interactions, which require real-time processing, high throughput, usage-based pricing, and automatic settlement.

The facilitating service is built in Rust, providing exceptional performance and low latency for high-throughput payment processing with sub-second transaction times and horizontal scalability. ATP implements usage-based payments aligned with how agents should be priced, calculating costs based on actual token usage (input/output tokens) rather than flat fees. While ATP shares a similar design philosophy with x402, it includes the crucial enhancement of usage-based payments, making it better suited for agentic trade scenarios where costs vary based on actual consumption. All payments are executed on-chain on the Solana blockchain, providing transparency, full auditability, and immutable settlement.

ATP enables enterprise-grade agent-to-agent transactions with interoperability across agent ecosystems, cost efficiency through consumption-based pricing, and scalability to support high-throughput deployments. All transactions are recorded on-chain, providing complete audit trails for compliance and financial reporting. ATP is committed to open standards, continuous performance optimization, usage-based pricing as the core principle, and maintaining high security standards for agent transactions.
